## About


This repository contains the frontend of my portfolio designed to showcase my engineering projects. It features a dynamic React-based UI that consumes a Django API. While this stack might seem complex for a portfolio site, I chose this particular architecture for several reasons: 

- Content management: projects are dynamically rendered from the API, which allows me to add and update content through Django's admin interface without touching the codebase.
- Secure contact form: the backend handles form submissions with proper validation and security.
- Full-stack expertise: the project itself serves as a real-world example of the technologies I work with professionally.
